this is a very unrefined draft of an email notifier app

checks for emails through xml feed, and triggers the .vbs script that blinks
the lights on the keyboard

if u use google, you have to set your account to be accessed through less secure apps
here https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps

it can be set up to read any xml email feed
